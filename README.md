# Iris-Classification-using-KNN
In this project the dataset of iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their
measurements.In this model KNN Machine Learning model is used to train and test dataset on the basis of 
measurements of the iris species and classified them. The Model is evaluated and accuracy has been calculated.
